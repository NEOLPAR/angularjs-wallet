AngularJS Wallet
================
Summary
----------
You will be creating a simple wallet application which allows you to add and remove amounts to and from your wallet. Once an amount is entered into the wallet, it should be listed along with the date it was added. Once an amount is removed from the wallet it should be listed along with the date it was removed. There should then be a grand total displaying how much money is currently in the wallet. There will be a responsive header with three menu items: Home, Reset, View Source.

Instructions
------------
1. You can choose the currency of the wallet, this should be displayed next to each item and the grand total.
2. For the currency symbol next the grand total you should use a font­awesome[1] icon and for the items in the wallet it should be text.
3. The javascript logic should be built on angular.js
4. At least one Angular.js directive should be used.
5. The input’s to add/remove amounts should have error checking and reporting.
6. The wallet data should persist on a page refresh for the same user until they click “Reset” in the menu. It is up to the developer to choose persistence method.
7. The code should be hosted in a Git repository, ideally we would like to see how you got to the end result via a series of commits as opposed to one large commit.
8. The menu should have menu items horizontally and collapse on mobile devices into a responsive menu. As an example of the layout and resize behaviour, view the font­awesome website in your browser to view the menu collapse effect.
9. The wallet can never contain a negative amount.
9. The method of adding/removing values to a wallet can be via separate inputs or a single combined input with a select box for add/remove.
10. There is no limit to the amount of values added or removed in the wallet.

Extras
------
1. Added several currencies and the option to set your currency. If you haven't choosen any currency, you will be redirected to the currencies view.
